## Dataset to Use:
This has 54,522 rows (18,174 children × 3 waves) with all variables cleaned and ready.

## Variables Available:

**IDs:** childid, wave, time (0,1,2 for GEE)

**Outcomes:**
- math, science (IRT scores)
- tch_approaches, tch_control, tch_external, tch_internal (teacher ratings, waves 2-4 only)

**Food Security (predictor):**
- fs_scale, fs_status, fs_raw (continuous & categorical)
- fs_baseline, fs_change, fs_cumulative (derived variables for your GEE model)

**Mediator:**
- tch_close, tch_conflict, tch_quality (waves 2-4 only)

**Controls:**
- x_chsex_r, X_RACETHP_R (demographics)
- x12sesl, ses, ses_q (SES - baseline, time-varying, quartiles for moderation)
- par1_ed, par2_ed, n_parents, hh_size (family)
- school_type, urbanicity, school_size (school)

### FLEXIBLE (2 OR 4 OR 9)
**File**: `/Desktop/653_final/data/ecls_long_FLEXIBLE.csv`
- 54,522 rows × 52 columns
- 38 time-varying variables
- **Includes** teacher variables (waves 2,4 only - not in wave 9)
- **USE THIS** - Has all variables from your proposal including mediator

### COMPLETE (2 AND 4 AND 9)
**File**: `/Desktop/653_final/data/ecls_long_COMPLETE.csv`
- 54,522 rows × 41 columns
- 27 time-varying variables
- **Excludes** teacher variables (not available wave 9)
- Perfectly balanced - all vars have data structure for all 3 waves

### CLEANED (Based on FLEXIBLE + Derived Variables)
**File**: `/Desktop/653_final/data/ecls_clean.csv`
- 54,522 rows × 57 columns
- Same as FLEXIBLE but with:
  - Missing codes cleaned (-1,-6,-7,-8,-9 → NA)
  - Derived variables: fs_baseline, fs_change, fs_cumulative, tch_quality, ses_q, time
- **USE THIS FOR GEE**

## Some Results（from AI）:

**Sample Sizes**:
- Wave 2: 12,494 with both FS & math (68.7%)
- Wave 4: 11,841 with both FS & math (65.1%)
- Wave 9: 8,528 with both FS & math (46.9%)

**Food Security Prevalence** (among those with data):
- Wave 2: 87.5% secure, 9.7% low, 2.9% very low
- Wave 4: 88.6% secure, 8.6% low, 2.8% very low
- Wave 9: 92.2% secure, 5.7% low, 2.1% very low
→ Food insecurity **decreases** over time

**Math Growth** (mean ± SD):
- Wave 2 (K): 49.9 ± 13.3
- Wave 4 (1st): 72.3 ± 15.7
- Wave 9 (5th): 120.0 ± 17.8
→ Clear **linear growth** pattern

**Variables
- [x] Food security (continuous & categorical) - **YES** (fs_scale, fs_status)
- [x] Food security change - **YES** (fs_baseline, fs_change, fs_cumulative)
- [x] Math scores - **YES** (waves 2,4,9)
- [ ] Reading scores - **NO** (not in source data - use science instead)
- [x] Teacher socioemotional - **YES** (tch_approaches, tch_control, etc.)
- [x] Teacher-child relationship - **YES** (tch_close, tch_conflict, tch_quality)
- [x] SES controls - **YES** (x12sesl baseline, ses time-varying, ses_q quartiles)
- [x] Demographics - **YES** (sex, race, age)
- [x] Parent education - **YES** (par1_ed, par2_ed)
- [x] School characteristics - **YES** (school_type, urbanicity, school_size)
